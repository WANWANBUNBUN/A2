            <h1>Thelonious Monk</h1>
            <p>Written and fact-checked by The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica</p>
            <p>Thelonious Monk, in full Thelonious Sphere Monk, (born Oct. 10, 1917, Rocky Mount, N.C., U.S.—died Feb.
                17, 1982, Englewood, N.J.), American pianist and composer who was among the first creators of modern
                jazz.

                As the pianist in the band at Minton's Playhouse, a nightclub in New York City, in the early 1940s, Monk
                had great influence on the other musicians who later developed the bebop movement. For much of his
                career, Monk performed and recorded with small groups. His playing was percussive and sparse, often
                being described as “angular,” and he used complex and dissonant harmonies and unusual intervals and
                rhythms. Monk’s music was known for its humorous, almost playful, quality. He was also one of the most
                prolific composers in the history of jazz. Many of his compositions, which were generally written in the
                12-bar blues or the 32-bar ballad form, became jazz standards. Among his best-known works are “Well, You
                Needn’t,” “I Mean You,” “Straight, No Chaser,” “Criss-Cross,” “Mysterioso,” “Epistrophy,” “Blue Monk,”
                and “ ’Round Midnight.” He influenced the flavour of much modern jazz, notably the work of George
                Russell, Randy Weston, and Cecil Taylor.
