            <h1>The demons and obsessions of jazz genius Thelonious Monk</h1>
            <p>By Candace Allen</p>
            <p>
                Consider this: both Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk were born in 1917. The creative DNA and
                brilliance of each musician were integral to the birth of modern jazz. For countless hours, weeks and
                months during the early 1940s they played, studied, argued and innovated together, along with Charlie
                Parker, drummer Kenny Clarke, bassist Oscar Pettiford, guitarist Charlie Christian and a steady
                progression of black men dedicated to exploring the possibilities of the music of their time, and to
                changing its shape. (And yes, aside from the pianist Mary Lou Williams and a number of female vocalists,
                this chapter in musical development is about the men.)
                Then, by virtue of his crowd-pleasing pyrotechnic style, “dizzy as a fox” personality and willingness to
                school the squares, combined with the organisational gifts necessary to keep his bands together,
                trumpeter Gillespies career soared to the stars while pianist Monk, the jobbing musician who couldn’t,
                more than wouldn’t, conform to the conventions of the job, spent most of his professional life
                struggling to support his family.
                Yet, although his dazzle is not dimmed, in their centennial year’s London jazz festival, Dizzy is
                treated to only one commemorative concert, while Monk and his music dominate two full days. We love
                Dizzy, but Monk.s multi-dimensional mystery tugs more insistently at our consciousness than Dizzy’s
                sophisticated, sun-drenched delight. The ineffable allure of shadows.

                Some of that mystery was down to the superficial reactions of white critics and audiences disconcerted
                by a taciturn black man whose erect posture made him appear taller than his already considerable height,
                and who saw no reason to verbally explain what he felt his music declared. In his habit of getting up
                and dancing to the solos of his bandmates, they postulated shaman mysticism and voodoo ritual rather
                than simple exultation and grooving to the beats. Fans and recording companies alike wanted a continuing
                cascade of new music – also part of a successful musician’s “job”, while Monk, in the manner of Cézanne,
                with his ceaseless studies of Mont St Victoire, or a cellist constantly revisiting Bach’s suites, sought
                new ways of revisiting groupings of notes he’d already ordered, knowing their possibilities to be
                infinite.
                A more substantive element of mystery for audiences and musicians alike was: why was the man so
                stubborn? Why did he insist on playing angular, spacious and “slow” when he could play as fast as the
                legendary James P Johnson and the fashion was for fast?
