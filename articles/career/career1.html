            <h1>My Time with Kurt Cobain</h1>
            <p>By Michael Azerrad</p>
            <p>In early 1992, when I first met Kurt Cobain, he and Courtney Love were living in a little apartment in a
                two-up-two-down building on an ordinary street in the Fairfax section of Los Angeles. I had flown there
                from New York to interview him for a Rolling Stone cover story, the one with a famous photograph of him
                wearing a homemade T-shirt that said “Corporate Magazines Still Suck.” I was nervous. Not much was known
                about Kurt at that point, other than he was this guy from Seattle who screamed in his songs, smashed his
                guitars, and might be a heroin addict. He was also the most celebrated rock musician on the planet.
                It was dusk when a taxi dropped me off at his place. Courtney greeted me at the door and graciously
                offered me a plate of grapes. There was a tiny, dimly lit living room with no furniture, LPs and guitars
                strewn around the floor, and a small Buddhist shrine with burning candles. As “Norwegian Wood” played
                faintly on a crappy stereo, Courtney led me down a short hallway to the bedroom. I got to the door and
                opened it to find Kurt lying in a little bed in a little room, his back against the wall, facing the
                doorway, his shocking blue eyes gazing at me through the subdued lighting. His bare feet stuck out past
                the bedsheets, and his toenails were painted a rosy hue. The smell of jasmine flowers wafted through the
                screen of the window above his head. To this day, whenever I smell jasmine I’m transported to that
                moment.
                “Hi,” he said, and two things struck me instantly. The first was: oh, wow, I know this guy. He wasn’t
                some sort of rock-and-roll space alien—he was actually like a lot of the stoners I went to high school
                with. (I was kind of a stoner in high school myself.) All the nervousness went away. The other thing I
                realized is uncomfortable to say: I sensed that he was one of those rock musicians who dies young. I’d
                never met someone like that before or even known many people who had died at all. I just sensed it. It
                turns out that a lot of other people around him did, too: his bandmate Dave Grohl sensed it, and so did
                Kurt’s wife, Courtney Love. Even Kurt’s own mother acknowledged it. It just wasn’t something that anyone
                would say out loud at the time.
                I sat down on a little footstool next to his bed, started up the tape recorder, and began asking him
                questions. I asked Kurt what he was like as a kid, and he said something about being small for his age.
                I stood up, unfurled my wiry five-foot-six-inch frame, and said, in a theatrically manly voice, “I don’t
                know what you’re talking about!” We exchanged smiles, and our bond grew from there. Somehow I got to
                talking about Arlo Guthrie’s “The Motorcycle Song” and how I’d play it on the family record player and
                run around the house pretending I was a motorcycle. And Kurt said, “I did that, too!” He said that his
                parents had divorced by the time he was ten years old and he’d been melancholic ever since. I told him
                how I’d felt the same way about my own parents’ divorce, when I was the same age. We grew up on the
                bands that so many American kids of our era did—Kiss, Cheap Trick, Queen, Black Sabbath—before having
                our lives changed by punk rock. So here I was, a bespectacled college-boy Rolling Stone journalist from
                New York City, connecting with a high-school dropout from the rural timber town of Aberdeen, Washington,
                whose dad worked in a lumber mill counting logs. But that didn’t make me anything special—a whole lot of
                people could have connected to Kurt Cobain. The beautiful thing was, he had a knack for conveying that
                in song, and in the most ineffable way.
                As I was talking with Kurt, he was experiencing heroin withdrawal. He told me he was in bed because he
                was nursing a cold, which made sense—he was coming off a tour that had gone from Australia to New
                Zealand to Singapore to Japan to Hawaii. All those shows and travel would naturally take a toll on
                anybody, even someone who had just turned twenty-five. It didn’t really seem like he had a cold, but I
                ignored that. Like many people around him, I just didn’t want to know. Which is ridiculous—I was a
                reporter.</p>
