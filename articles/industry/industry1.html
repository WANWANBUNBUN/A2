            <h1>Cool jazz and modal jazz</h1>
            <p>Written and fact-checked by The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1948, Davis formed a nonet that included the renowned jazz artists Gerry Mulligan, J.J.
                Johnson, Kenny Clarke, and Lee Konitz, as well as players on French horn and tuba, instruments rarely
                heard in a jazz context. Mulligan, Gil Evans, and pianist John Lewis did most of the band’s
                arrangements, which juxtaposed the flexible, improvisatory nature of bebop with a thickly textured
                orchestral sound. The group was short-lived but during its brief history recorded a dozen tracks that
                were originally released as singles (1949–50). These recordings changed the course of modern jazz and
                paved the way for the West Coast styles of the 1950s. The tracks were later collected in the album Birth
                of the Cool (1957).
                During the early 1950s Davis struggled with a drug addiction that affected his playing, yet he still
                managed to record albums that rank among his best, including several with such jazz notables as Sonny
                Rollins, Milt Jackson, and Thelonious Monk. In 1954, having overcome the addiction, Davis embarked on a
                two-decade period during which he was considered the most innovative musician in jazz. He formed classic
                small groups in the 1950s that featured saxophone legends John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley,
                pianists Red Garland and Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummers “Philly” Joe Jones and Jimmy
                Cobb. Davis’s albums recorded during this era, including ’Round About Midnight (1956), Workin’ (1956),
                Steamin’ (1956), Relaxin’ (1956), and Milestones (1958), affected the work of numerous other artists. He
                capped this period of his career with Kind of Blue (1959), perhaps the most celebrated album in the
                history of jazz. A mellow, relaxed collection, the album includes the finest recorded examples of modal
                jazz, a style in which improvisations are based upon sparse chords and nonstandard scales rather than on
                complex, frequently changing chords. The modal style lends itself to solos that are focused on melody;
                this accessible quality ensured Kind of Blue’s popularity with jazz fans.
